<H3>fix nvk command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID nvk 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>nvk = style name of this fix command 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix 1 all nvk 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform constant kinetic energy integration using the Gaussian
thermostat to update position and velocity for atoms in the group each
timestep.  V is volume; K is kinetic energy. This creates a system
trajectory consistent with the isokinetic ensemble.
</P>
<P>The equations of motion used are those of Minary et al in
<A HREF = "#nvk-Minary">(Minary)</A>, a variant of those initially given by Zhang in
<A HREF = "#nvk-Zhang">(Zhang)</A>.
</P>
<P>The kinetic energy will be held constant at its value given when fix
nvk is initiated. If a different kinetic energy is desired, the
<A HREF = "velocity.html">velocity</A> command should be used to change the kinetic
energy prior to this fix.
</P>

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The Gaussian thermostat only works when it is applied to all atoms in
the simulation box. Therefore, the group must be set to all.
</P>
<P>This fix has not yet been implemented to work with the RESPA integrator.
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the USER-MISC package.  It is only enabled if LAMMPS
was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
