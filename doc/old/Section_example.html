<H3>7. Example problems 
</H3>
<P>The LAMMPS distribution includes an examples sub-directory with many
sample problems.  Many are 2d models that run quickly are are
straightforward to visualize, requiring at most a couple of minutes to
run on a desktop machine.  Each problem has an input script (in.*) and
produces a log file (log.*) when it runs.  Some use a data file
(data.*) of initial coordinates as additional input.  A few sample log
file run on different machines and different numbers of processors are
included in the directories to compare your answers to.  E.g. a log
file like log.date.crack.foo.P means the "crack" example was run on P
processors of machine "foo" on that date (i.e. with that version of
LAMMPS).
</P>
<P>Many of the input files have commented-out lines for creating dump
files and image files.
</P>
<P>If you uncomment the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> command in the input script, a
text dump file will be produced, which can be animated by various
<A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/viz.html">visualization programs</A>.
</P>
<P>If you uncomment the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump image</A> command in the input
script, and assuming you have built LAMMPS with a JPG library, JPG
snapshot images will be produced when the simulation runs.  They can
be quickly post-processed into a movie using commands described on the
<A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> doc page.
</P>
<P>Animations of many of the examples can be viewed on the Movies section
of the <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov">LAMMPS web site</A>.
</P>
<P>There are two kinds of sub-directories in the examples dir.  Lowercase
dirs contain one or a few simple, quick-to-run problems.  Uppercase
dirs contain up to several complex scripts that illustrate a
particular kind of simulation method or model.  Some of these run for
longer times, e.g. to measure a particular quantity.
</P>
<P>Lists of both kinds of directories are given below.

<P>Here is how you can run and visualize one of the sample problems:
</P>
<PRE>cd indent
cp ../../src/lmp_linux .           # copy LAMMPS executable to this dir
lmp_linux -in in.indent            # run the problem 
</PRE>
<P>Running the simulation produces the files <I>dump.indent</I> and
<I>log.lammps</I>.  You can visualize the dump file of snapshots with a
variety of 3rd-party tools highlighted on the
<A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/viz.html">Visualization</A> page of the LAMMPS
web site.
</P>
<P>If you uncomment the <A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> line(s) in the input
script a series of JPG images will be produced by the run (assuming
you built LAMMPS with JPG support; see <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_2">Section
2.2</A> for details).  These can be viewed
individually or turned into a movie or animated by tools like
ImageMagick or QuickTime or various Windows-based tools.  See the
<A HREF = "dump_image.html">dump image</A> doc page for more details.  E.g. this
Imagemagick command would create a GIF file suitable for viewing in a
browser.

<P>Nearly all of these directories have README files which give more
details on how to understand and use their contents.
</P>
<P>The USER directory has a large number of sub-directories which
correspond by name to a USER package.  They contain scripts that
illustrate how to use the command(s) provided in that package.  Many
of the sub-directories have their own README files which give further
instructions.  See the <A HREF = "Section_packages.html">Section 4</A> doc
page for more info on specific USER packages.
