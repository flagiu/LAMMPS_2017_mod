<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Apply a spring force to the center-of-mass (COM) of chunks of atoms as
defined by the <A HREF = "compute_chunk_atom.html">compute chunk/atom</A> command.
Chunks can be molecules or spatial bins or other groupings of atoms.
This is a way of tethering each chunk to its initial COM coordinates.
</P>
<P>The <I>chunkID</I> is the ID of a compute chunk/atom command defined in the
input script.  It is used to define the chunks.  The <I>comID</I> is the ID
of a compute com/chunk command defined in the input script.  It is
used to compute the COMs of each chunk.
</P>
<P>At the beginning of the first <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> or
<A HREF = "minimize.html">minimize</A> command after this fix is defined, the
initial COM of each chunk is calculated and stored as R0m, where M is
the chunk number.  Thereafter, at every timestep (or minimization
iteration), the current COM of each chunk is calculated as Rm.  A
restoring force of magnitude K (Rm - R0m) Mi / Mm is applied to each
atom in each chunk where <I>K</I> is the specified spring constant, Mi is
the mass of the atom, and Mm is the total mass of all atoms in the
chunk.  Note that <I>K</I> thus represents the spring constant for the
total force on each chunk of atoms, not for a spring applied to each
atom.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>energy</I> option is supported by this
fix to add the energy stored in all the springs to the system's potential
energy as part of <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermodynamic output</A>.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>respa</I> option is supported by this
fix. This allows to set at which level of the <A HREF = "run_style.html">r-RESPA</A>
integrator the fix is adding its forces. Default is the outermost level.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>.  The scalar is the
energy of all the springs, i.e. 0.5 * K * r^2 per-spring.
</P>
<P>The scalar value calculated by this fix is "extensive".
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
</P>
<P>The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the <A HREF = "minimize.html">minimize</A> command.
</P>
<P>NOTE: If you want the spring energies to be included in the total
potential energy of the system (the quantity being minimized), you
MUST enable the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>energy</I> option for this
fix.
