</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Dump a snapshot of atom quantities to one or more files every N
timesteps in a format readable by the <A HREF = "http://www.vtk.org">VTK visualization
toolkit</A> or other visualization tools that use it,
e.g. <A HREF = "http://www.paraview.org">ParaView</A>.  The timesteps on which dump
output is written can also be controlled by a variable; see the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify every</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>This dump style is similar to <A HREF = "dump.html">dump_style custom</A> but uses
the VTK library to write data to VTK simple legacy or XML format
depending on the filename extension specified for the dump file.  This
can be either <I>*.vtk</I> for the legacy format or <I>*.vtp</I> and <I>*.vtu</I>,
respectively, for XML format; see the <A HREF = "http://www.vtk.org/VTK/img/file-formats.pdf">VTK
homepage</A> for a detailed
description of these formats.  Since this naming convention conflicts
with the way binary output is usually specified (see below), the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify binary</A> command allows setting of a
binary option for this dump style explicitly.
</P>
<P>Only information for atoms in the specified group is dumped.  The
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify thresh and region</A> commands can also
alter what atoms are included; see details below.
</P>
<P>As described below, special characters ("*", "%") in the filename
determine the kind of output.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Because periodic boundary conditions are enforced only
on timesteps when neighbor lists are rebuilt, the coordinates of an
atom written to a dump file may be slightly outside the simulation
box.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Unless the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify sort</A> option
is invoked, the lines of atom information written to dump files will
be in an indeterminate order for each snapshot.  This is even true
when running on a single processor, if the <A HREF = "atom_modify.html">atom_modify
sort</A> option is on, which it is by default.  In this
case atoms are re-ordered periodically during a simulation, due to
spatial sorting.  It is also true when running in parallel, because
data for a single snapshot is collected from multiple processors, each
of which owns a subset of the atoms.
</P>
<P>For the <I>vtk</I> style, sorting is off by default. See the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> doc page for details.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The dimensions of the simulation box are written to a separate file
for each snapshot (either in legacy VTK or XML format depending on the
format of the main dump file) with the suffix <I>_boundingBox</I> appended
to the given dump filename.
</P>
<P>For an orthogonal simulation box this information is saved as a
rectilinear grid (legacy .vtk or .vtr XML format).
</P>
<P>Triclinic simulation boxes (non-orthogonal) are saved as
hexahedrons in either legacy .vtk or .vtu XML format.
</P>
<P>Style <I>vtk</I> allows you to specify a list of atom attributes to be
written to the dump file for each atom.  The list of possible attributes
is the same as for the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump_style custom</A> command; see
its doc page for a listing and an explanation of each attribute.
</P>
<P>NOTE: Since position data is required to write VTK files the atom
attributes "x y z" do not have to be specified explicitly; they will
be included in the dump file regardless.  Also, in contrast to the
<I>custom</I> style, the specified <I>vtk</I> attributes are rearranged to
ensure correct ordering of vector components (except for computes and
fixes - these have to be given in the right order) and duplicate
entries are removed.
</P>
<P>The VTK format uses a single snapshot of the system per file, thus
a wildcard "*" must be included in the filename, as discussed below.
Otherwise the dump files will get overwritten with the new snapshot
each time.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Dumps are performed on timesteps that are a multiple of N (including
timestep 0) and on the last timestep of a minimization if the
minimization converges.  Note that this means a dump will not be
performed on the initial timestep after the dump command is invoked,
if the current timestep is not a multiple of N.  This behavior can be
changed via the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify first</A> command, which
can also be useful if the dump command is invoked after a minimization
ended on an arbitrary timestep.  N can be changed between runs by
using the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify every</A> command.
The <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify every</A> command
also allows a variable to be used to determine the sequence of
timesteps on which dump files are written.  In this mode a dump on the
first timestep of a run will also not be written unless the
<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify first</A> command is used.
</P>
<P>Dump filenames can contain two wildcard characters.  If a "*"
character appears in the filename, then one file per snapshot is
written and the "*" character is replaced with the timestep value.
For example, tmp.dump*.vtk becomes tmp.dump0.vtk, tmp.dump10000.vtk,
tmp.dump20000.vtk, etc.  Note that the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify pad</A>
command can be used to insure all timestep numbers are the same length
(e.g. 00010), which can make it easier to read a series of dump files
in order with some post-processing tools.
</P>
<P>If a "%" character appears in the filename, then each of P processors
writes a portion of the dump file, and the "%" character is replaced
with the processor ID from 0 to P-1 preceded by an underscore character.
For example, tmp.dump%.vtp becomes tmp.dump_0.vtp, tmp.dump_1.vtp, ...
tmp.dump_P-1.vtp, etc.  This creates smaller files and can be a fast
mode of output on parallel machines that support parallel I/O for output.
</P>
<P>By default, P = the number of processors meaning one file per
processor, but P can be set to a smaller value via the <I>nfile</I> or
<I>fileper</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A> command.
These options can be the most efficient way of writing out dump files
when running on large numbers of processors.
</P>
<P>For the legacy VTK format "%" is ignored and P = 1, i.e., only
processor 0 does write files.
</P>
<P>Note that using the "*" and "%" characters together can produce a
large number of small dump files!
</P>
<P>If <I>dump_modify binary</I> is used, the dump file (or files, if "*" or
"%" is also used) is written in binary format.  A binary dump file
will be about the same size as a text version, but will typically
write out much faster.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>vtk</I> style does not support writing of gzipped dump files.
</P>
<P>The <I>vtk</I> dump style is part of the USER-VTK package. It is
only enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package. See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>To use this dump style, you also must link to the VTK library.  See
the info in lib/vtk/README and insure the Makefile.lammps file in that
directory is appropriate for your machine.
</P>
<P>The <I>vtk</I> dump style supports neither buffering or custom format
strings.

<A HREF = "dump_modify.html">dump_modify</A>, <A HREF = "undump.html">undump</A>
</P>
<P><B>Default:</B>
</P>
<P>By default, files are written in ASCII format. If the file extension
is not one of .vtk, .vtp or .vtu, the legacy VTK file format is used.
