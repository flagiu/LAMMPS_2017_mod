<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Calculate the dynamical matrix from molecular dynamics simulations
based on fluctuation-dissipation theory for a group of atoms.
</P>
<P>Consider a crystal with \(N\) unit cells in three dimensions labeled
\(l = (l_1, l_2, l_3)\) where \(l_i\) are integers.  Each unit cell is
defined by three linearly independent vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\),
\(\mathbf{a}_2\), \(\mathbf{a}_3\) forming a parallelipiped,
containing \(K\) basis atoms labeled \(k\).
</P>
<P>Based on fluctuation-dissipation theory, the force constant
coefficients of the system in reciprocal space are given by
(<A HREF = "#Campana">Campana</A> , <A HREF = "#Kong">Kong</A>)
</P>
<P>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{\Phi}_{k\alpha,k^\prime \beta}(\mathbf{q}) = k_B T \mathbf{G}^{-1}_{k\alpha,k^\prime \beta}(\mathbf{q})
\end{equation}
</P>
<P>where \(\mathbf{G}\) is the Green's functions coefficients given by
</P>
<P>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{G}_{k\alpha,k^\prime \beta}(\mathbf{q}) = \left< \mathbf{u}_{k\alpha}(\mathbf{q}) \bullet \mathbf{u}_{k^\prime \beta}^*(\mathbf{q}) \right>
\end{equation}
</P>
<P>where \(\left< \ldots \right>\) denotes the ensemble average, and
</P>
<P>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}_{k\alpha}(\mathbf{q}) = \sum_l \mathbf{u}_{l k \alpha} \exp{(i\mathbf{qr}_l)}
\end{equation}
</P>
<P>is the \(\alpha\) component of the atomic displacement for the \(k\)
th atom in the unit cell in reciprocal space at \(\mathbf{q}\). In
practice, the Green's functions coefficients can also be measured
according to the following formula,
</P>
<P>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{G}_{k\alpha,k^\prime \beta}(\mathbf{q}) =
\left< \mathbf{R}_{k \alpha}(\mathbf{q}) \bullet \mathbf{R}^*_{k^\prime \beta}(\mathbf{q}) \right>
- \left<\mathbf{R}\right>_{k \alpha}(\mathbf{q}) \bullet \left<\mathbf{R}\right>^*_{k^\prime \beta}(\mathbf{q})
\end{equation}
</P>
<P>where \(\mathbf{R}\) is the instantaneous positions of atoms, and
\(\left<\mathbf{R}\right>\) is the averaged atomic positions. It
gives essentially the same results as the displacement method and is
easier to implement in an MD code.
</P>
<P>Once the force constant matrix is known, the dynamical matrix
\(\mathbf{D}\) can then be obtained by
</P>
<P>\begin{equation}
\mathbf{D}_{k\alpha, k^\prime\beta}(\mathbf{q}) =
(m_k m_{k^\prime})^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathbf{\Phi}_{k \alpha, k^\prime \beta}(\mathbf{q})
\end{equation}
</P>
<P>whose eigenvalues are exactly the phonon frequencies at \(\mathbf{q}\).
</P>
<P>This fix uses positions of atoms in the specified group and calculates
two-point correlations.  To achieve this. the positions of the atoms
are examined every <I>Nevery</I> steps and are Fourier-transformed into
reciprocal space, where the averaging process and correlation
computation is then done.  After every <I>Noutput</I> measurements, the
matrix \(\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{q})\) is calculated and inverted to
obtain the elastic stiffness coefficients.  The dynamical matrices are
then constructed and written to <I>prefix</I>.bin.timestep files in binary
format and to the file <I>prefix</I>.log for each wavevector
\(\mathbf{q}\).
</P>
<P>A detailed description of this method can be found in
(<A HREF = "#Kong2011">Kong2011</A>).
</P>
<P>The <I>sysdim</I> keyword is optional.  If specified with a value smaller
than the dimensionality of the LAMMPS simulation, its value is used
for the dynamical matrix calculation.  For example, using LAMMPS ot
model a 2D or 3D system, the phonon dispersion of a 1D atomic chain
can be computed using <I>sysdim</I> = 1.
</P>
<P>The <I>nasr</I> keyword is optional.  An iterative procedure is employed to
enforce the acoustic sum rule on \(\Phi\) at \(\Gamma\), and the number
provided by keyword <I>nasr</I> gives the total number of iterations. For a
system whose unit cell has only one atom, <I>nasr</I> = 1 is sufficient;
for other systems, <I>nasr</I> = 10 is typically sufficient.
</P>
<P>The <I>map_file</I> contains the mapping information between the lattice
indices and the atom IDs, which tells the code which atom sits at
which lattice point; the lattice indices start from 0. An auxiliary
code, <A HREF = "http://code.google.com/p/latgen">latgen</A>, can be employed to
generate the compatible map file for various crystals.
</P>
<P>In case one simulates an aperiodic system, where the whole simulation
box is treated as a unit cell, one can set <I>map_file</I> as <I>GAMMA</I>, so
that the mapping info will be generated internally and a file is not
needed. In this case, the dynamical matrix at only the gamma-point
will/can be evaluated. Please keep in mind that fix-phonon is designed
for cyrstals, it will be inefficient and even degrade the performance
of lammps in case the unit cell is too large.
</P>
<P>The calculated dynamical matrix elements are written out in
<A HREF = "units.html">energy/distance^2/mass</A> units.  The coordinates for <I>q</I>
points in the log file is in the units of the basis vectors of the
corresponding reciprocal lattice.
</P>
<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>temp</I> option is supported by this
fix. You can use it to change the temperature compute from thermo_temp
to the one that reflects the true temperature of atoms in the group.
</P>
<P>No global scalar or vector or per-atom quantities are stored by this
fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>.
</P>
<P>Instead, this fix outputs its initialization information (including
mapping information) and the calculated dynamical matrices to the file
<I>prefix</I>.log, with the specified <I>prefix</I>.  The dynamical matrices are
also written to files <I>prefix</I>.bin.timestep in binary format.  These
can be read by the post-processing tool in tools/phonon to compute the
phonon density of states and/or phonon dispersion curves.
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords
of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
</P>
<P>This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix assumes a crystalline system with periodical lattice. The
temperature of the system should not exceed the melting temperature to
keep the system in its solid state.
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the USER-PHONON package.  It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>This fix requires LAMMPS be built with an FFT library.  See the
<A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_2">Making LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
