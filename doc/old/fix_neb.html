<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Add nudging forces to atoms in the group for a multi-replica
simulation run via the <A HREF = "neb.html">neb</A> command to perform a nudged
elastic band (NEB) calculation for finding the transition state.
Hi-level explanations of NEB are given with the <A HREF = "neb.html">neb</A> command
and in <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_5">Section_howto 5</A> of the manual.
The fix neb command must be used with the "neb" command and defines
how inter-replica nudging forces are computed.  A NEB calculation is
divided in two stages. In the first stage n replicas are relaxed
toward a MEP until convergence.  In the second stage, the climbing
image scheme (see <A HREF = "#Henkelman2">(Henkelman2)</A>) is enabled, so that the
replica having the highest energy relaxes toward the saddle point
(i.e. the point of highest energy along the MEP), and a second
relaxation is performed.
</P>
<P>A key purpose of the nudging forces is to keep the replicas equally
spaced.  During the NEB calculation, the 3N-length vector of
interatomic force Fi = -Grad(V) for each replica I is altered.  For
all intermediate replicas (i.e. for 1 < I < N, except the climbing
replica) the force vector becomes:
</P>
<PRE>Fi = -Grad(V) + (Grad(V) dot T') T' + Fnudge_parallel + Fnudge_perp 
</PRE>
<P>T' is the unit "tangent" vector for replica I and is a function of Ri,
Ri-1, Ri+1, and the potential energy of the 3 replicas; it points
roughly in the direction of (Ri+i - Ri-1); see the
<A HREF = "#Henkelman1">(Henkelman1)</A> paper for details.  Ri are the atomic
coordinates of replica I; Ri-1 and Ri+1 are the coordinates of its
neighbor replicas.  The term (Grad(V) dot T') is used to remove the
component of the gradient parallel to the path which would tend to
distribute the replica unevenly along the path.  Fnudge_parallel is an
artificial nudging force which is applied only in the tangent
direction and which maintains the equal spacing between replicas (see
below for more information).  Fnudge_perp is an optional artificial
spring which is applied in a direction perpendicular to the tangent
direction and which prevent the paths from forming acute kinks (see
below for more information).
</P>
<P>In the second stage of the NEB calculation, the interatomic force Fi
for the climbing replica (the replica of highest energy after the
first stage) is changed to:
</P>
<PRE>Fi = -Grad(V) + 2 (Grad(V) dot T') T' 
</PRE>
<P>and the relaxation procedure is continued to a new converged MEP.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The keyword <I>parallel</I> specifies how the parallel nudging force is
computed.  With a value of <I>neigh</I>, the parallel nudging force is
computed as in <A HREF = "#Henkelman1">(Henkelman1)</A> by connecting each
intermediate replica with the previous and the next image:
</P>
<PRE>Fnudge_parallel = <I>Kspring</I> * (|Ri+1 - Ri| - |Ri - Ri-1|) 
</PRE>
<P>Note that in this case the specified <I>Kspring) is in force/distance
units.
</P>
With a value of <I>ideal</I>, the spring force is computed as suggested in
<A HREF = "#WeinenE">(WeinenE)</A> 

<PRE>Fnudge_parallel = -<I>Kspring</I> * (RD-RDideal) / (2 * meanDist) 
</PRE>
<P>where RD is the "reaction coordinate" see <A HREF = "neb.html">neb</A> section, and
RDideal is the ideal RD for which all the images are equally spaced.
I.e. RDideal = (I-1)*meanDist when the climbing replica is off, where
I is the replica number).  The meanDist is the average distance
between replicas.  Note that in this case the specified <I>Kspring) is
in force units.
</P>
<P>Note that the <I>ideal</I> form of nudging can often be more effective at
keeping the replicas equally spaced.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The keyword <I>perp</I> specifies if and how a perpendicual nudging force
is computed.  It adds a spring force perpendicular to the path in
order to prevent the path from becoming too kinky.  It can
significantly improve the convergence of the NEB calculation when the
resolution is poor.  I.e. when few replicas are used; see
<A HREF = "#Maras1">(Maras)</A> for details.
</P>
<P>The perpendicular spring force is given by
</P>
<PRE>Fnudge_perp = <I>Kspring2</I> * F(Ri-1,Ri,Ri+1) (Ri+1 + Ri-1 - 2 Ri) 
</PRE>
<P>where <I>Kspring2</I> is the specified value.  F(Ri-1 Ri R+1) is a smooth
scalar function of the angle Ri-1 Ri Ri+1.  It is equal to 0.0 when
the path is straight and is equal to 1 when the angle Ri-1 Ri Ri+1 is
acute.  F(Ri-1 Ri R+1) is defined in <A HREF = "#Jonsson">(Jonsson)</A>.
</P>
<P>If <I>Kspring2</I> is set to 0.0 (the default) then no perpendicular spring
force is added.
</P>
<HR>

<P>By default, no additional forces act on the first and last replicas
during the NEB relaxation, so these replicas simply relax toward their
respective local minima.  By using the key word <I>end</I>, additional
forces can be applied to the first and/or last replicas, to enable
them to relax toward a MEP while constraining their energy.
</P>
<P>The interatomic force Fi for the specified replica becomes:
</P>
<PRE>Fi = -Grad(V) + (Grad(V) dot T' + (E-ETarget)*Kspring3) T',  <I>when</I> Grad(V) dot T' < 0
Fi = -Grad(V) + (Grad(V) dot T' + (ETarget- E)*Kspring3) T', <I>when</I> Grad(V) dot T' > 0

</PRE>
<P>where E is the current energy of the replica and ETarget is the target
energy.  The "spring" constant on the difference in energies is the
specified <I>Kspring3</I> value.
</P>
<P>When <I>estyle</I> is specified as <I>first</I>, the force is applied to the
first replica.  When <I>estyle</I> is specified as <I>last</I>, the force is
applied to the last replica.  Note that the <I>end</I> keyword can be used
twice to add forces to both the first and last replicas.
</P>
<P>For both these <I>estyle</I> settings, the target energy <I>ETarget</I> is set
to the initial energy of the replica (at the start of the NEB
calculation).
</P>
<P>If the <I>estyle</I> is specified as <I>last/efirst</I> or <I>last/efirst/middle</I>,
force is applied to the last replica, but the target energy <I>ETarget</I>
is continuously set to the energy of the first replica, as it evolves
during the NEB relaxation.
</P>
<P>The difference between these two <I>estyle</I> options is as follows.  When
<I>estyle</I> is specified as <I>last/efirst</I>, no change is made to the
inter-replica force applied to the intermediate replicas (neither
first or last).  If the initial path is too far from the MEP, an
intermediate repilica may relax "faster" and reach a lower energy than
the last replica.  In this case the intermediate replica will be
relaxing toward its own local minima.  This behavior can be prevented
by specifying <I>estyle</I> as <I>last/efirst/middle</I> which will alter the
inter-replica force applied to intermediate replicas by removing the
contribution of the gradient to the inter-replica force.  This will
only be done if a particular intermediate replica has a lower energy
than the first replica.  This should effectively prevent the
intermediate replicas from over-relaxing.
</P>
<P>After converging a NEB calculation using an <I>estyle</I> of
<I>last/efirst/middle</I>, you should check that all intermediate replicas
have a larger energy than the first replica. If this is not the case,
the path is probably not a MEP.
</P>
<P>Finally, note that if the last replica converges toward a local
minimum which has a larger energy than the energy of the first
replica, a NEB calculation using an <I>estyle</I> of <I>last/efirst</I> or
<I>last/efirst/middle</I> cannot reach final convergence.
