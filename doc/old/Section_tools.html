<H3>9. Additional tools 
</H3>
<P>LAMMPS is designed to be a computational kernel for performing
molecular dynamics computations.  Additional pre- and post-processing
steps are often necessary to setup and analyze a simulation. A
list of such tools can be found on the LAMMPS home page
at <A HREF = "http://lammps.sandia.gov/prepost.html">http://lammps.sandia.gov/prepost.html</A>
</P>
<P>A few additional tools are provided with the LAMMPS distribution
and are described in this section.
</P>
<P>Our group has also written and released a separate toolkit called
<A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">Pizza.py</A> which provides tools for doing setup, analysis,
plotting, and visualization for LAMMPS simulations.  Pizza.py is
written in <A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A> and is available for download from <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/pizza.html">the
Pizza.py WWW site</A>.
</P>




<P>Note that many users write their own setup or analysis tools or use
other existing codes and convert their output to a LAMMPS input format
or vice versa.  The tools listed here are included in the LAMMPS
distribution as examples of auxiliary tools.  Some of them are not
actively supported by Sandia, as they were contributed by LAMMPS
users.  If you have problems using them, we can direct you to the
authors.
</P>
<P>The source code for each of these codes is in the tools sub-directory
of the LAMMPS distribution.  There is a Makefile (which you may need
to edit for your platform) which will build several of the tools which
reside in that directory.  Most of them are larger packages in their
own sub-directories with their own Makefiles and/or README files.

<H4><A NAME = "amber"></A>amber2lmp tool 
</H4>
<P>The amber2lmp sub-directory contains two Python scripts for converting
files back-and-forth between the AMBER MD code and LAMMPS.  See the
README file in amber2lmp for more information.
</P>
<P>These tools were written by Keir Novik while he was at Queen Mary
University of London.  Keir is no longer there and cannot support
these tools which are out-of-date with respect to the current LAMMPS
version (and maybe with respect to AMBER as well).  Since we don't use
these tools at Sandia, you'll need to experiment with them and make
necessary modifications yourself.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "binary"></A>binary2txt tool 
</H4>
<P>The file binary2txt.cpp converts one or more binary LAMMPS dump file
into ASCII text files.  The syntax for running the tool is
</P>
<PRE>binary2txt file1 file2 ... 
</PRE>
<P>which creates file1.txt, file2.txt, etc.  This tool must be compiled
on a platform that can read the binary file created by a LAMMPS run,
since binary files are not compatible across all platforms.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "charmm"></A>ch2lmp tool 
</H4>
<P>The ch2lmp sub-directory contains tools for converting files
back-and-forth between the CHARMM MD code and LAMMPS.
</P>
<P>They are intended to make it easy to use CHARMM as a builder and as a
post-processor for LAMMPS. Using charmm2lammps.pl, you can convert a
PDB file with associated CHARMM info, including CHARMM force field
data, into its LAMMPS equivalent.  Using lammps2pdb.pl you can convert
LAMMPS atom dumps into PDB files.
</P>
<P>See the README file in the ch2lmp sub-directory for more information.

chains and solvent atoms can strongly overlap, so LAMMPS needs to run
the system initially with a "soft" pair potential to un-overlap it.
The syntax for running the tool is
</P>
<PRE>chain < def.chain > data.file 
</PRE>
<P>See the def.chain or def.chain.ab files in the tools directory for
examples of definition files.  This tool was used to create the
system for the <A HREF = "Section_perf.html">chain benchmark</A>.
