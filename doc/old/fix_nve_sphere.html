<H3>fix nve/sphere command 
</H3>
<H3>fix nve/sphere/omp command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID nve/sphere 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command 

<LI>nve/sphere = style name of this fix command 

<LI>zero or more keyword/value pairs may be appended 

<LI>keyword = <I>update</I> or <I>disc</I> 

<PRE>  <I>update</I> value = <I>dipole</I> or <I>dipole/dlm</I>
    dipole = update orientation of dipole moment during integration
    dipole/dlm = use DLM integrator to update dipole orientation
  <I>disc</I> value = none = treat particles as 2d discs, not spheres 
</PRE>

</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix 1 all nve/sphere
fix 1 all nve/sphere update dipole
fix 1 all nve/sphere disc
fix 1 all nve/sphere update dipole/dlm 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform constant NVE integration to update position, velocity, and
angular velocity for finite-size spherical particles in the group each
timestep.  V is volume; E is energy.  This creates a system trajectory
consistent with the microcanonical ensemble.
</P>
<P>This fix differs from the <A HREF = "fix_nve.html">fix nve</A> command, which
assumes point particles and only updates their position and velocity.
</P>
<P>If the <I>update</I> keyword is used with the <I>dipole</I> value, then the
orientation of the dipole moment of each particle is also updated
during the time integration.  This option should be used for models
where a dipole moment is assigned to finite-size particles,
e.g. spheroids via use of the <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style hybrid sphere
dipole</A> command.
</P>
<P>The default dipole orientation integrator can be changed to the
Dullweber-Leimkuhler-McLachlan integration scheme
<A HREF = "#nh-Dullweber">(Dullweber)</A> when using <I>update</I> with the value
<I>dipole/dlm</I>. This integrator is symplectic and time-reversible,
giving better energy conservation and allows slightly longer timesteps
at only a small additional computational cost.
</P>
<P>If the <I>disc</I> keyword is used, then each particle is treated as a 2d
disc (circle) instead of as a sphere.  This is only possible for 2d
simulations, as defined by the <A HREF = "dimension.html">dimension</A> keyword.
The only difference between discs and spheres in this context is their
moment of inertia, as used in the time integration.

<P>Styles with a <I>gpu</I>, <I>intel</I>, <I>kk</I>, <I>omp</I>, or <I>opt</I> suffix are
functionally the same as the corresponding style without the suffix.
They have been optimized to run faster, depending on your available
hardware, as discussed in <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section 5</A>
of the manual.  The accelerated styles take the same arguments and
should produce the same results, except for round-off and precision
issues.
</P>
<P>These accelerated styles are part of the GPU, USER-INTEL, KOKKOS,
USER-OMP and OPT packages, respectively.  They are only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with those packages.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>You can specify the accelerated styles explicitly in your input script
by including their suffix, or you can use the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_6">-suffix command-line
switch</A> when you invoke LAMMPS, or you can
use the <A HREF = "suffix.html">suffix</A> command in your input script.
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_accelerate.html">Section 5</A> of the manual for
more instructions on how to use the accelerated styles effectively.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about this fix is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to this fix.  No global or per-atom quantities are stored
by this fix for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of this fix can
be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
This fix is not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix requires that atoms store torque and angular velocity (omega)
and a radius as defined by the <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style sphere</A>
command.  If the <I>dipole</I> keyword is used, then they must also store a
dipole moment as defined by the <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style dipole</A>
command.
</P>
<P>All particles in the group must be finite-size spheres.  They cannot
be point particles.
</P>
<P>Use of the <I>disc</I> keyword is only allowed for 2d simulations, as
defined by the <A HREF = "dimension.html">dimension</A> keyword.
