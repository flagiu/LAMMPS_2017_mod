<H3>temper/grem command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>temper/grem N M lambda fix-ID thermostat-ID seed1 seed2 index 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>N = total # of timesteps to run
<LI>M = attempt a tempering swap every this many steps
<LI>lambda = initial lambda for this ensemble
<LI>fix-ID = ID of fix_grem
<LI>thermostat-ID = ID of the thermostat that controls kinetic temperature
<LI>seed1 = random # seed used to decide on adjacent temperature to partner with
<LI>seed2 = random # seed for Boltzmann factor in Metropolis swap
<LI>index = which temperature (0 to N-1) I am simulating (optional) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>temper/grem 100000 1000 $<I>lambda</I> fxgREM fxnvt 0 58728
temper/grem 40000 100 $<I>lambda</I> fxgREM fxnpt 0 32285 $<I>walkers</I> 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Run a parallel tempering or replica exchange simulation in LAMMPS
partition mode using multiple generalized replicas (ensembles) of a
system defined by <A HREF = "fix_grem.html">fix grem</A>, which stands for the
generalized replica exchange method (gREM) originally developed by
<A HREF = "#KimStraub">(Kim)</A>.  It uses non-Boltzmann ensembles to sample over first
order phase transitions. The is done by defining replicas with an
enthalpy dependent effective temperature
</P>
<P>Two or more replicas must be used.  See the <A HREF = "temper.html">temper</A>
command for an explanation of how to run replicas on multiple
partitions of one or more processors.
</P>
<P>This command is a modification of the <A HREF = "temper.html">temper</A> command and
has the same dependencies, restraints, and input variables which are
discussed there in greater detail.
</P>
<P>Instead of temperature, this command performs replica exchanges in
lambda as per the generalized ensemble enforced by <A HREF = "fix_grem.html">fix
grem</A>.  The desired lambda is specified by <I>lambda</I>,
which is typically a variable previously set in the input script, so
that each partition is assigned a different temperature.  See the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for more details.  For example:
</P>
<PRE>variable lambda world 400 420 440 460
fix fxnvt all nvt temp 300.0 300.0 100.0
fix fxgREM all grem $<I>lambda</I> -0.05 -50000 fxnvt
temper 100000 100 $<I>lambda</I> fxgREM fxnvt 3847 58382 
</PRE>
<P>would define 4 lambdas with constant kinetic temperature but unique
generalized temperature, and assign one of them to <A HREF = "fix_grem.html">fix
grem</A> used by each replica, and to the grem command.
</P>
<P>As the gREM simulation runs for <I>N</I> timesteps, a swap between adjacent
ensembles will be attempted every <I>M</I> timesteps.  If <I>seed1</I> is 0,
then the swap attempts will alternate between odd and even pairings.
If <I>seed1</I> is non-zero then it is used as a seed in a random number
generator to randomly choose an odd or even pairing each time.  Each
attempted swap of temperatures is either accepted or rejected based on
a Metropolis criterion, derived for gREM by <A HREF = "#Kim">(Kim)</A>, which uses
<I>seed2</I> in the random number generator.
</P>
<P>File management works identical to the <A HREF = "temper.html">temper</A> command.
Dump files created by this fix contain continuous trajectories and
require post-processing to obtain per-replica information.
</P>
<P>The last argument <I>index</I> in the grem command is optional and is used
when restarting a run from a set of restart files (one for each
replica) which had previously swapped to new lambda.  This is done
using a variable. For example if the log file listed the following for
a simulation with 5 replicas:
</P>
<PRE>500000 2 4 0 1 3 
</PRE>
<P>then a setting of
</P>
<PRE>variable walkers world 2 4 0 1 3 
</PRE>
<P>would be used to restart the run with a grem command like the example
above with $<I>walkers</I> as the last argument. This functionality is
identical to <A HREF = "temper.html">temper</A>.
</P>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This command can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the USER-MISC
package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making LAMMPS</A> section
for more info on packages.
</P>
<P>This command must be used with <A HREF = "fix_grem.html">fix grem</A>.
