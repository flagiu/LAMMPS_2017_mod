<H3>fix cmap command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix ID group-ID cmap filename 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>ID, group-ID are documented in <A HREF = "fix.html">fix</A> command
<LI>cmap = style name of this fix command
<LI>filename = force-field file with CMAP coefficients 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>fix            myCMAP all cmap ../potentials/cmap36.data
read_data      proteinX.data fix myCMAP crossterm CMAP
fix_modify     myCMAP energy yes 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command enables CMAP crossterms to be added to simulations which
use the CHARMM force field.  These are relevant for any CHARMM model
of a peptide or protein sequences that is 3 or more amino-acid
residues long; see <A HREF = "#Buck">(Buck)</A> and <A HREF = "#Brooks2">(Brooks)</A> for details,
including the analytic energy expressions for CMAP interactions.  The
CMAP crossterms add additional potential energy contributions to pairs
of overlapping phi-psi dihedrals of amino-acids, which are important
to properly represent their conformational behavior.
</P>
<P>The examples/cmap directory has a sample input script and data file
for a small peptide, that illustrates use of the fix cmap command.
</P>
<P>As in the example above, this fix should be used before reading a data
file that contains a listing of CMAP interactions.  The <I>filename</I>
specified should contain the CMAP parameters for a particular version
of the CHARMM force field.  Two such files are including in the
lammps/potentials directory: charmm22.cmap and charmm36.cmap.
</P>
<P>The data file read by the "read_data" must contain the topology of all
the CMAP interactions, similar to the topology data for bonds, angles,
dihedrals, etc.  Specially it should have a line like this
in its header section:
</P>
<PRE>N crossterms 
</PRE>
<P>where N is the number of CMAP crossterms.  It should also have a section
in the body of the data file like this with N lines:
</P>
<PRE>CMAP 
</PRE>
<PRE>       1       1       8      10      12      18      20
       2       5      18      20      22      25      27
       [...]
       N       3     314     315     317      318    330 
</PRE>
<P>The first column is an index from 1 to N to enumerate the CMAP terms;
it is ignored by LAMMPS.  The 2nd column is the "type" of the
interaction; it is an index into the CMAP force field file.  The
remaining 5 columns are the atom IDs of the atoms in the two 4-atom
dihedrals that overlap to create the CMAP 5-body interaction.  Note
that the "crossterm" and "CMAP" keywords for the header and body
sections match those specified in the read_data command following the
data file name; see the <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> doc page for
more details.
</P>
<P>A data file containing CMAP crossterms can be generated from a PDB
file using the charmm2lammps.pl script in the tools/ch2lmp directory
of the LAMMPS distribution.  The script must be invoked with the
optional "-cmap" flag to do this; see the tools/ch2lmp/README file for
more information.
</P>
<P>The potential energy associated with CMAP interactions can be output
as described below.  It can also be included in the total potential
energy of the system, as output by the
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> command, if the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify
energy</A> command is used, as in the example above.  See
the note below about how to include the CMAP energy when performing an
<A HREF = "minimize.html">energy minimization</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix writes the list of CMAP crossterms to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  See the <A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command
for info on how to re-specify a fix in an input script that reads a
restart file, so that the operation of the fix continues in an
uninterrupted fashion.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>energy</I> option is supported by this
fix to add the potential "energy" of the CMAP interactions system's
potential energy as part of <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermodynamic output</A>.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
<A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>.  The scalar is the
potential energy discussed above.  The scalar value calculated by this
fix is "extensive".
</P>
<P>No parameter of this fix can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of
the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command.
</P>
<P>The forces due to this fix are imposed during an energy minimization,
invoked by the <A HREF = "minimize.html">minimize</A> command.
</P>
<P>NOTE: If you want the potential energy associated with the CMAP terms
forces to be included in the total potential energy of the system (the
quantity being minimized), you MUST enable the
<A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> <I>energy</I> option for this fix.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix can only be used if LAMMPS was built with the MOLECULE
package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info on packages.
