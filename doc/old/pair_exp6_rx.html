<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Style <I>exp6/rx</I> is used in reaction DPD simulations, where the
coarse-grained (CG) particles are composed of <I>m</I> species whose
reaction rate kinetics are determined from a set of <I>n</I> reaction rate
equations through the <A HREF = "fix_rx.html">fix rx</A> command.  The species of
one CG particle can interact with a species in a neighboring CG
particle through a site-site interaction potential model.  The
<I>exp6/rx</I> style computes an exponential-6 potential given by
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC = "Eqs/pair_exp6_rx.jpg">
</CENTER>
<P>where the <I>epsilon</I> parameter determines the depth of the potential
minimum located at <I>Rm</I>, and <I>alpha</I> determines the softness of the repulsion.
</P>
<P>The coefficients must be defined for each species in a given particle
type via the <A HREF = "pair_coeff.html">pair_coeff</A> command as in the examples
above, where the first argument is the filename that includes the
exponential-6 parameters for each species.  The file includes the
species tag followed by the <I>alpha</I>, <I>epsilon</I> and <I>Rm</I>
parameters. The format of the file is described below.
</P>
<P>The second and third arguments specify the site-site interaction
potential between two species contained within two different
particles.  The species tags must either correspond to the species
defined in the reaction kinetics files specified with the <A HREF = "fix_rx.html">fix
rx</A> command or they must correspond to the tag "1fluid",
signifying interaction with a product species mixture determined
through a one-fluid approximation.  The interaction potential is
weighted by the geometric average of either the mole fraction concentrations
or the number of molecules associated with the interacting coarse-grained
particles (see the <I>fractional</I> or <I>molecular</I> weighting pair style options).
The coarse-grained potential is stored before and after the
reaction kinetics solver is applied, where the difference is defined
to be the internal chemical energy (uChem).
</P>
<P>The fourth argument specifies the type of scaling that will be used
to scale the EXP-6 parameters as reactions occur.  Currently, there
are three scaling options:  <I>exponent</I>, <I>polynomial</I> and <I>none</I>.
</P>
<P>Exponent scaling requires two additional arguments for scaling
the <I>Rm</I> and <I>epsilon</I> parameters, respectively.  The scaling factor
is computed by phi^exponent, where phi is the number of molecules
represented by the coarse-grain particle and exponent is specified
as a pair coefficient argument for <I>Rm</I> and <I>epsilon</I>, respectively.
The <I>Rm</I> and <I>epsilon</I> parameters are multiplied by the scaling
factor to give the scaled interaction parameters for the CG particle.
</P>
<P>Polynomial scaling requires a filename to be specified as a pair
coeff argument.  The file contains the coefficients to a fifth order
polynomial for the <I>alpha</I>, <I>epsilon</I> and <I>Rm</I> parameters that depend
upon phi (the number of molecules represented by the CG particle).
The format of a polynomial file is provided below.
</P>
<P>The <I>none</I> option to the scaling does not have any additional pair coeff
arguments.  This is equivalent to specifying the <I>exponent</I> option with
<I>Rm</I> and <I>epsilon</I> exponents of 0.0 and 0.0, respectively.
</P>
<P>The final argument specifies the interaction cutoff (optional).

"#"; blank lines or lines starting with "#" can be used as comments
between sections.

<P>Following a blank line, the next N lines list the species and their
corresponding parameters.  The first argument is the species tag, the
second argument is the exp6 tag, the 3rd argument is the <I>alpha</I>
parameter (energy units), the 4th argument is the <I>epsilon</I> parameter
(energy-distance^6 units), and the 5th argument is the <I>Rm</I> parameter
(distance units).  If a species tag of "1fluid" is listed as a pair
coefficient, a one-fluid approximation is specified where a
concentration-dependent combination of the parameters is computed
through the following equations:

<P>This pair style does not support mixing.  Thus, coefficients for all
I,J pairs must be specified explicitly.

tail corrections to energy and pressure for the A,C terms in the
pair interaction.
