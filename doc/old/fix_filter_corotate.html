<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix implements a corotational filter for a mollified impulse
method. In biomolecular simulations, it allows the usage of larger
timesteps for long-range electrostatic interactions.  For details, see
<A HREF = "#Fath2017">(Fath)</A>.
</P>
<P>When using <A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style respa</A> for a biomolecular
simulation with high-frequency covalent bonds, the outer time-step is
restricted to below ~ 4fs due to resonance problems. This fix filters
the outer stage of the respa and thus a larger (outer) time-step can
be used. Since in large biomolecular simulations the computation of
the long-range electrostatic contributions poses a major bottleneck,
this can significantly accelerate the simulation.
</P>
<P>The filter computes a cluster decomposition of the molecular structure
following the criteria indicated by the options a, b, t and m. This
process is similar to the approach in <A HREF = "fix_shake.html">fix shake</A>,
however, the clusters are not kept contrained. Instead, the position
is slightly modified only for the computation of long-range forces. A
good cluster decomposition constitutes in building clusters which
contain the fastest covalent bonds inside clusters.
</P>
<P>If the clusters are chosen suitably, the <A HREF = "run_style.html">run_style
respa</A> is stable for outer time-steps of at least 8fs.

<P><B>Restart, fix_modify, output, run start/stop, minimize info:</B>
</P>
<P>No information about these fixes is written to <A HREF = "restart.html">binary restart
files</A>.  None of the <A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> options
are relevant to these fixes.  No global or per-atom quantities are
stored by these fixes for access by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output
commands</A>.  No parameter of these fixes
can be used with the <I>start/stop</I> keywords of the <A HREF = "run.html">run</A>
command.  These fixes are not invoked during <A HREF = "minimize.html">energy
minimization</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>This fix is part of the USER-MISC package. It is only enabled if
LAMMPS was built with that package. See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#start_3">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
</P>
<P>Currently, it does not support <A HREF = "molecule.html">molecule templates</A>.
